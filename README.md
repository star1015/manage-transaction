## Transaction React Application

**Frontend**: React, Typescript, Ant Design()

**Backend**: Fake API with static JSON

## Requirement
The assignment includes writing a simple frontend application revolving around financial transactions. 
We're providing you with the actual transaction data which you will find within the attached data.json file. 
Your project should showcase a clear and organized structure. Usage of `git` (or equivalent svn) to document your work is mandatory. 
Usage of 3rd-party libraries is highly appreciated, there's no need to reinvent the wheel!

Main features:
- use React
- be able to show transactions in an appealing way
- be able to add a new transaction (doesn't have to be persisted)

Optional:
- use Typescript
- showcase loading behavior (by mocking the retrieval of data.json from an api)



## Instructions
```
1. yarn install
2. yarn start
```
